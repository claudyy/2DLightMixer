With the 2D Light Mixer system, Sprites can be used to mix with a Post Processing shader over the target camera. There are various ways to mix it.

How it works
The shader takes the render Texture from a second Camera, which only renders the light layer. 
The light layer can be defined by the user. The Light Camera Background is set to black. 
Setup sprites that are set to light layer to render them has light.
